# Introduction

This library introduces and defines concepts common to transposition 
ciphers.

## Prerequisites

Before working through this lab, you'll need 
  * Cryptol to be installed and
  * this module to load successfully.

You'll also need experience with
  * loading modules and evaluating functions in the interpreter,
  * the `:prove` and `:sat` commands, and defining `property`s
  * `import` and import lists (e.g. `import My::Module (def, other_def)`),
  * sequence comprehensions
  * ...

## Skills You'll Learn

This module will define a _transposition cipher_, in which message 
characters are _transposed_ in a different order. Additionally, the 
module will recall some important cipher properties (that decryption 
recovers encrypted plaintext and that encryption is injective), where 
these operations are defined in terms of _permutations_.

## Load This Module

This lab is a
[literate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) 
Cryptol document --- that is, it can be loaded directly into the 
Cryptol interpreter. Load this module from within the Cryptol 
interpreter running in the `cryptol-course` directory with:

```Xcryptol-session
Cryptol> :m labs::Transposition::TranspositionAnswers
Loading module Cryptol
Loading module specs::Primitive::Symmetric::Cipher::Block::Cipher
Loading module specs::Primitive::Symmetric::Cipher::Block::DES
Loading module labs::CryptoProofs::CryptoProofsAnswers
Loading module labs::Transposition::CommonPropertiesAnswers
Loading module labs::Transposition::TranspositionAnswers
```

We start by defining the module for this lab:

```cryptol
module labs::Transposition::TranspositionAnswers where
```

You do not need to enter the above into the interpreter; the previous 
`:m ...` command loaded this literate Cryptol file automatically.
In general, you should run `Xcryptol-session` commands in the 
interpreter and only change `cryptol` code as directed by the 
exercises, reloading for `:m ...` to import your changes.

Additionally, we will import some common properties to apply to this 
spec:

```cryptol
import labs::Transposition::CommonPropertiesAnswers (injective, inverts)
```

# Transposition Ciphers

In a [_transposition cipher_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_cipher), 
messages are encrypted by _transposing_ (rearranging) characters, 
then decrypted by inverting this rearrangement to recover the 
original order. Confidentiality depends upon a shared secret between 
a sender and receiver so that only they know how the message was 
transposed. A _permutation mapping_, a 1:1 mapping from the ordered 
set of indices ``[0..`(m-1)]`` to a sequence of the same indices in a 
different order, formalizes this transposition. 

Before moving on to simple transposition ciphers such as Scytale, 
Rail Fence, and Route, we first go over some basics that will be 
required for transposition ciphers in general.

## Permutations and Mappings

A _mapping_ is an operation that associates an element of a given set 
(_domain_) with one or more elements of a (same or different) set 
(_range_). A _bijective_ mapping maps each element of the domain to 
a distinct element of the range, and vice-versa. A transposition 
cipher _transposes_ a message (a sequence of length `m`) to a 
scrambled message containing the same elements in a different order 
(a _permutation mapping_) known to the sender and receiver. To 
decrypt a message, a receiver _inverts_ this permutation to yield the 
original message.

**EXERCISE**: Define a function `isPermutation` that returns whether 
`seq': [n]a` is a permutation of `seq: [n]a`. Check your function 
using `isPermutation_test`.

(Hint: A helper function will...help.)

```cryptol
/** number of occurrences of `item` in `seq` */
itemCount:
    {n, a}
    (fin n, Eq a) =>
    [n]a -> a -> Integer
itemCount seq item = counts ! 0
  where
    counts = [ 0 ]
           # [ if x == item then count + 1 else count
             | count <- counts
             | x <- seq
             ]

/** is `seq'` a permutation of `seq`? */
isPermutation:
    {n, a}
    (fin n, Eq a) =>
    [n]a -> [n]a -> Bit
isPermutation seq seq' = and
    [ itemCount seq x == itemCount seq' x
    | x <- seq
    ]
```

```cryptol
/** `isPermutation` test vectors */
property isPermutation_test = and
    [   isPermutation "" ""
    ,   isPermutation "A" "A"
    ,   isPermutation "AA" "AA"
    ,   isPermutation "AB" "AB"
    ,   isPermutation "AB" "BA"
    ,   isPermutation "AAB" "ABA"
    ,   isPermutation "BAB" "ABB"
    ,   isPermutation "BAB" "BBA"

    , ~ isPermutation "A" "B"
    , ~ isPermutation "AA" "AB"
    , ~ isPermutation "AAB" "ABB"
    , ~ isPermutation "BAB" "AAB"
    ]
```

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Transposition::TranspositionAnswers> :check isPermutation_test
Using exhaustive testing.
Passed 1 tests.
Q.E.D.
```

**EXERCISE**: Define a function `isPermutationMapping`, perhaps using 
the built-in functions `all` and `elem`, that recognizes a 
permutation mapping. Check your function using 
`isPermuationMapping_test`.

(Hint: ``take`{n} [0...]`` returns the first `n` numbers starting 
from `0`, i.e. the identity mapping. `isPermutationMapping` can be 
defined using this sequence as one of the arguments to `all`. It 
may be simpler to define a variant of `elem` that takes arguments in 
a different order.)

```cryptol
/** Is `pi` a permutation of `[0,n)`? */
isPermutationMapping:
    {n, w}
    (fin n, Eq w, Integral w, Literal 0 w) =>
    [n]w -> Bit
isPermutationMapping pi = all (elem' pi) (take`{n} [0...])
  where
    elem' p x = elem x p

/** `isPermutationMapping` test vectors */
property isPermutationMapping_test = and
    [   isPermutationMapping []
    ,   isPermutationMapping [0]
    ,   isPermutationMapping [0,1]
    ,   isPermutationMapping [1,0]
    ,   isPermutationMapping [0,1,2]
    ,   isPermutationMapping [0,2,1]
    ,   isPermutationMapping [2,0,1]

    , ~ isPermutationMapping [1]
    , ~ isPermutationMapping [0,0]
    , ~ isPermutationMapping [0,2]
    , ~ isPermutationMapping [1,2]
    , ~ isPermutationMapping [0,1,1]
    , ~ isPermutationMapping [2,0,2]
    ]
```

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Transposition::TranspositionAnswers> :check isPermutationMapping_test
Using exhaustive testing.
Passed 1 tests.
Q.E.D.
```

**EXERCISE**: Define a function `permute` that permutes a sequence 
`seq: [n]a` according to a permutation mapping `pi: [n]w`.

(Hint: Consider built-in function `@@`.)

```cryptol
permute:
    {n, a, w}
    Integral w =>
    [n]w -> [n]a -> [n]a
permute pi seq = seq @@ pi
```

**EXERCISE**: Define a predicate `permute_permutes` that, given a 
permutation mapping `pi: [n]w` and a sequence `seq: [n]a`, `permute` 
returns a permutation of `seq`. Prove/check this predicate for 
various sequence lengths and types.

```cryptol
permute_permutes:
    {n, a, w}
    (fin n, Eq a, Eq w, Integral w, Literal 0 w) =>
    [n]w -> [n]a -> Bit
permute_permutes pi seq =
    isPermutationMapping pi ==> 
    isPermutation seq (permute pi seq)
```

```Xcryptol-session

```

**EXERCISE**: Given a permutation mapping `pi: [n]w`, return its 
inverse `pi'` such that `permute pi'` `inverts` `permute pi`. 
(`inverts` is imported from `labs::Transposition::CommonProperties`.)

(Hint: The idiomatic solution to this exercise, where `inverse` is 
defined with ``take`{n} [0...]`` as one of the arguments to 
`updates`, is perhaps the most elegant in all of Cryptol.)

```cryptol
/** return the inverse of a permutation mapping `pi` */
inverse:
    {n, w}
    (fin n, Integral w, Literal 0 w) =>
    [n]w -> [n]w
inverse pi = updates pi pi (take [0...])
```

**EXERCISE**: State a predicate `inverse_inverts` that `inverse` 
satisfies its specification above. Prove this predicate for various 
sequence lengths and types.

```cryptol
/** `inverse` inverts permutation mapping `pi` */
inverse_inverts:
    {n, a, w}
    (fin n, Eq a, Eq w, Integral w, Literal 0 w) =>
    [n]w -> [n]a -> Bit
inverse_inverts pi seq =
    isPermutationMapping pi ==>
    inverts (permute (inverse pi)) (permute pi) seq
```

```Xcryptol-session

```

**EXERCISE**: Define a predicate that `permute pi` is `injective` if 
`pi` is a permutation mapping, and `:prove` it for various sequence 
lengths and types. (`injective` is imported from 
`labs::Transposition::CommonProperties`.)

```cryptol
/** `permute pi` is `injective` if `pi` is a permutation mapping */
permute_injective:
    {n, a, w}
    (fin n, Eq a, Eq w, Integral w, Literal 0 w) =>
    [n]w -> [n]a -> [n]a -> Bit
permute_injective pi seq seq' =
    isPermutationMapping pi ==> injective (permute pi) seq seq'
```

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Transposition::TranspositionAnswers> :prove permute_injective`{4, Char, Integer}

```

# Encryption and Decryption

With this foundation in place, we can define `encrypt` and `decrypt` 
operations for a transposition cipher in terms of a permutation 
mapping `pi`.

**EXERCISE**: Define `encrypt` and `decrypt` in terms of `permute` 
and a permutation mapping `pi`. Do not modify anything left of `=`.

```cryptol
encrypt = permute
decrypt pi = permute (inverse pi)
```

**EXERCISE**: Define predicates `cipher_recovery` and 
`cipher_injective` stating that `decrypt pi` inverts `encrypt pi` and 
that `encrypt pi` is injective, given a permutation mapping `pi`. 
(These are direct assignments to earlier predicate definitions; do 
not modify anything left of `=`.)

```cryptol
cipher_recovery = inverse_inverts
cipher_injective = permute_injective
```

# Padding and Filtering

Most transposition ciphers are based on an analogue to block size. 
For example, Scytale has a rod diameter, but not all messages wrap 
evenly around this rod, leaving a gap that must be managed when 
encrypting and decrypting an "uneven" message. Likewise, in Rail 
Fence, messages are split by "cycles" determined by the number of 
rails in the fence, and not all messages are a multiple of cycle 
length. One option to overcome such a limitation is to pad a 
message, encrypt it, send the encrypted padded message, and remove 
the padding characters after decryption. However, since 
transposition ciphers are based on message _indices_ rather than 
_content_, the sender can simply derive a permutation mapping based 
on padded message length, remove indices that are out of place, and 
send the message permuted with this reduced mapping; the receiver can 
similarly derive the reduced permutation mapping, based on length, to 
decrypt the message.

Removing padding characters and reducing permutation mappings are 
examples of the abstract problem of sequence filtering:  Given a 
predicate `f: a -> Bit`, return from a sequence `seq: [n]a` the 
elements `seq': [m]a` such that `all f seq' == True`.

**EXERCISE**: ...just kidding. Normally, we might introduce an exercise 
to define such a function at this point. However, in Cryptol's type 
system, this turns out to be a somewhat difficult problem. Indeed, 
this module's author, for whom all prior concepts covered in the lab 
came naturally, struggled for a day to arrive at what turned out to 
be an incorrect (but easily correctable) solution. This problem 
baffled all but the lead instructor for the course. Readers are 
invited to similarly struggle at this point, but hints showing a 
couple ways to solve this problem are provided below for those who 
instead wish to endure a diatribe on different strategies to solve 
this problem. Even we're not that mean!

## Index swapping

By definition, in a transposition cipher, characters of a message are 
rearranged. The most basic rearrangement is to swap characters at 
two positions (indices) in a message (sequence). However, while 
permutation mappings provide a more efficient mechanism to swap all 
characters at once, swapping turns out to be useful for the sequence 
filtering problem...

**EXERCISE**: Define a function to swap items at indices `i` and `j` 
of a sequence `seq: [n]a` for number `n` and arbitrary character type 
`a`, using `@` and `update`, then again using `@@` and `updates` (do 
not use a temporary variable in either definition). Use the 
`swap_equiv` predicate to verify that your definitions are equivalent, 
then the `swap_correct` predicate to show that one of them is correct. 
(Because they are equivalent, this will infer that the other swap 
function is also correct.)

```cryptol
/** Swap `i`th and `j`th entries of sequence `a` via `@`/`update` */
swap_update:
    {n, a, v, w}
    (Integral v, Integral w) =>
    [n]a -> v -> w -> [n]a
swap_update seq i j = update (update seq i (seq @ j)) j (seq @ i)

/** Swap `i`th and `j`th entries of sequence `a` via `@@`/`updates` */
swap_updates:
    {n, a, w}
    Integral w =>
    [n]a -> w -> w -> [n]a
swap_updates seq i j = updates seq [i,j] (seq @@ [j,i])

// Define `swap` as either of above swap functions
swap = swap_updates
```

```cryptol
/** `swap_update` is functionally equivalent to `swap_updates` */
swap_equiv:
    {n, a, w}
    (fin n, Eq a, Cmp w, Integral w, Literal (max n n) w) =>
    [n]a -> w -> w -> Bit
swap_equiv seq i j =
    0 <= i ==> i < `n ==>
    0 <= j ==> j < `n ==>
    swap_update`{v = w} seq i j == swap_updates seq i j

/** `swap` is correct; it just swaps values at specified indices */
swap_correct:
    {n, a, w}
    (Eq a, Cmp w, Integral w, Literal (max n (max n n)) w) =>
    [n]a -> w -> w -> w -> Bit
swap_correct seq i j k =
    0 <= i ==> i < `n ==>
    0 <= j ==> j < `n ==>
    0 <= k ==> k < `n ==>
    seq' @ k ==
        if k == i then seq @ j
        |  k == j then seq @ i
                  else seq @ k
      where
        seq' = swap seq i j
```

### Swap-Partitioning

Using `swap`, we can define a function that "partitions" a sequence 
into a subsequence of all elements in the original sequence that 
satisfy a predicate, followed by a subsequence of all elements that 
do not. To achieve this, we can "walk" through the original 
sequence, and if the current character satisfies the predicate, keep 
walking; otherwise, swap the current character with the next one, and 
branch here while the subsequent character is another padding 
character. For this strategy, the "current" sequence and index would 
be captured as a sequence comprehension (much as in a block cipher's 
iterations of a round function).

To better visualize this, suppose we've been given a String infused 
with padding characters `-`, and wish to move them to the end of the 
message. The following function achieves this for any message length 
including the empty message `""` of length `0`:

```cryptol
/** Shift `-` characters to the end of a `String` */
rearrange: {n} (fin n) => String n -> String n
rearrange w = take (last out).0
  where
    out = [(w, 0, 0)]
        # [ if w'@i != '-' then (w', i', j)
             | j <= i      then (w', i, i')
             | w'@j != '-' then (swap w' i j, i', j+1)
            else (w', i, j+1)
            where i' = zext`{width (n + 1)} i + 1
                  j' = zext`{width (n + 1)} j + 1
          | (w', i, j) <- out
          | _ <- tail [0 .. n : [width n]] ]

/** Visualize the steps of `rearrange` */
rearrange_trace: {n} (fin n) => String n -> [_](String (1+n), [width (1 + n)], [width (1 + n)])
rearrange_trace w = out
  where
    out = [(w # ['-'], 0, 0)]
        # [ if w'@i != '-' then (w', i', j)
             | j <= i      then (w', i, i')
             | w'@j != '-' then (swap w' i j, i', j+1)
            else (w', i, j+1)
            where i' = zext`{width (n + 1)} i + 1
                  j' = zext`{width (n + 1)} j + 1
          | (w', i, j) <- out
          | _ <- tail [0 .. n : [width n]] ]
```

Here's how this function works for the string `"HE-LL-O-"`:

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Transposition::TranspositionAnswers> :s ascii=on
labs::Transposition::TranspositionAnswers> :s base=10
labs::Transposition::TranspositionAnswers> rearrange_trace "HE-LL-O-" 
[("HE-LL-O--", 0, 0), ("HE-LL-O--", 1, 0), ("HE-LL-O--", 2, 0),
 ("HE-LL-O--", 2, 3), ("HEL-L-O--", 3, 4), ("HELL--O--", 4, 5),
 ("HELL--O--", 4, 6), ("HELLO----", 5, 7), ("HELLO----", 5, 8)]
```

**EXERCISE**: Using `rearrange` as a blueprint, define a function 
`partition` that, given a predicate `f: a -> Bit` and sequence 
`seq: [n]a`, "partitions" the sequence, returning `seq': [n]a` 
such that there exists some `i` such that 
`all f seqt' == True` and `all f' seqf' == True`, where 
`f' x = ~ f x` and ``(seqt', seqf') = splitAt`{i} seq'``. Use the 
`partition_rearranges` predicate to `:prove` (or if you lose 
patience, `:check`) that you defined `partition` correctly, for 
various sequence lengths.

```cryptol
/**
 * "Partition" a sequence `seq` by a filtering predicate `f` such 
 * that the output `seq'` has all the items satisfying `f`, followed 
 * by all items not satisfying `f`
 */
partition: {n, a} (fin n) => (a -> Bit) -> [n]a -> [n]a
partition f seq = take (last out).0
  where
    out = ([(seq, 0, 0)] : [1]([n]a, [max 1 (width n)], [max 1 (width n)]))
        # [ if f (w' @ i) then (w', i', j)
             | j <= i    then (w', i, i')
             | f (w' @ j)  then (swap w' i j, i', j')
            else (w', i, j')
            where
                i' = i + 1
                j' = j + 1
          | (w', i, j) <- out
          | _ <- tail [0 .. n : [width n]] ]
```

```cryptol
/** `partition` (with arguments) is equivalent to `rearrange` */
partition_rearranges: {n} (fin n) => String n -> Bit
partition_rearranges =
    partition isNotPadding === rearrange
      where
        isNotPadding c = c != '-'
```

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Transposition::TranspositionAnswers> :prove partition_rearranges`{4}

```

**EXERCISE**: Is it possible to programmatically determine `i` for an 
arbitrary sequence `seq` and predicate `f`?  Why (not)?  Regardless, 
how might we be able to use `partition` for transposition ciphers?

### Rotate-Partitioning

Another possible approach is to walk through a sequence, rotating the 
remaining subsequence left iff its first element does not satisfy the 
filtering predicate. Visualizing this for `rearrange` on 
`"HE-LL-O-"`, this approach would proceed as follows:

"HE-LL-O-"
"HELL-O--"
"HELLO---"

To pull this off would require a way to enumerate over subsequences 
split before and after a current index, e.g.

("", "HE-LL-O-")
("H", "E-LL-O-")
("HE", "-LL-O-") -> ("HE", "LL-O--")
...

**EXERCISE**: Is it possible to enumerate over sequence indices and 
pass each index `i` to compute ``splitAt`{i} seq``?  Why (not)?  If 
it is possible, feel free to submit a pull request!  Otherwise, can 
we apply another technique to operate over these subsequences?

Unfortunately, there is no mechanism for "type sequence 
comprehensions". However, we can apply recursion...

```cryptol
/**
 * Recursively shift `-` characters to the end of a string using 
 * sequence rotation
 */
rearrange':
    {n} fin n =>
    String n -> String n
rearrange' w =
    if `n == (0: [width n]) then w
    | w @ 0 == '-' then rearrange' (take`{max 1 n - 1} (w <<< 1)) # (take`{min 1 n} ['-'])
    else (take`{min 1 n} [w @ 0]) # rearrange' (drop`{min 1 n} w)

/** The iterative and recursive `rearrange(')` functions are equivalent */
rearrange_equiv:
    {n} fin n =>
    String n -> Bit
rearrange_equiv = rearrange`{n} === rearrange'`{n}
```

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Transposition::TranspositionAnswers> :prove rearrange_equiv`{8}

(Total Elapsed Time: 0.477s, using "Z3")
labs::Transposition::TranspositionAnswers> :prove rearrange_equiv`{12}

(Total Elapsed Time: 35.182s, using "Z3")
labs::Transposition::TranspositionAnswers> :check rearrange_equiv`{128}
Using random testing.
Passed 100 tests.
Expected test coverage: 0.00% (100 of 2^^1024 values)
```

In addition to being recursive, this approach requires tricks with 
`min` and `max` to establish type consistency for an empty sequence. 
What kind of fool thought this up?  (See 
[Intro to Type Hackery](../Language/IntroTypeHackery.md) 
for a better, more detailed example of such hackery...when this lab 
gets merged into the repo.)

**EXERCISE**: Using `rearrange'` as a blueprint, define a function 
`partition'` that does the same as `partition`, and try to convince 
yourself (via `:prove` and/or `:check` commands using 
`partition'_rearranges`) that your definition of `partition'` is 
correct for various sequence sizes and types.

```cryptol
partition':
    {n, a} fin n =>
    (a -> Bit) -> [n]a -> [n]a
partition' f w =
    if `n == (0: [width n]) then w
    | ~ (f (w @ 0)) then partition' f (take`{max 1 n - 1} (w <<< 1)) # (take`{min 1 n} [w @ 0])
    else (take`{min 1 n} [w @ 0]) # partition' f (drop`{min 1 n} w)
```

```cryptol
/** `partition'` (with arguments) is equivalent to `rearrange'` */
partition'_rearranges : {n} (fin n) => String n -> Bit
partition'_rearranges =
    partition' isNotPadding === rearrange'
      where
        isNotPadding c = c != '-'
```

**EXERCISE**: Define a property `partition'_equiv` that `partition` 
and `partition'` are functionally equivalent. Are they?  If not, why 
not?  Can either or both still be used for transposition ciphers?

```cryptol
/** `partition` and `partition'` are functionally equivalent...or are they? */
partition'_equiv: {n, a} (fin n, Eq a) => (a -> Bit) -> [n]a -> Bit
partition'_equiv f = partition`{n} f === partition'`{n} f
```

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Transposition::TranspositionAnswers> :prove partition'_equiv`{8, Bit} (\b -> b)
Q.E.D.
(Total Elapsed Time: 1.669s, using "Z3")
labs::Transposition::TranspositionAnswers> :prove partition'_equiv`{8, [32]} (\b -> b ! 0)
Counterexample
partition'_equiv`{8, [32]} (\b -> b ! 0)
  [0x00000000, 0x01000000, 0x00000020, 0x40000020, 0x00000040,
   0x00000001, 0x00000001, 0x00000002] = False
(Total Elapsed Time: 0.147s, using "Z3")
```

**EXERCISE**: Better yet! Cryptol now has built-in sorting primitives
`sort` and `sortBy`. Try your hand at using the `sortBy` primitive
to implement partitioning. (Hint: `True > False`.)

```cryptol
partition'': {n, a} fin n => (a -> Bit) -> [n]a -> [n]a
partition'' f w = sortBy cmp w
  where
    cmp a b = f a >= f b
```

```cryptol
/** `partition''` and `partition'` are functionally equivalent */
partition''_equiv: {n, a} (fin n, Eq a) => (a -> Bit) -> [n]a -> Bit
partition''_equiv f = partition`{n} f === partition''`{n} f
```

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Transposition::TranspositionAnswers> :prove partition''_equiv`{10, [8]} (\a -> a != '-')
Q.E.D.
(Total Elapsed Time: 1.811s, using "Z3")
```

I'm sure you're thinking we should've just started with the `sortBy`
solution. Well, us developing this lab is part of the reason the
`sortBy` primitive exists. So, consider the above as an historical
reference of our earlier stumblings.

## Reduction of Padded Partition Mappings

Phew! Now that we have defined a `partition` function...

**EXERCISE**: Define a function `unpad` that uses `partition` (or 
`partition'`) and `take` to reduce a permutation mapping `(n + p) w` 
to a possibly smaller `[n]w` (where `p >= 0`). Use 
`unpad_unpads` to check your definition of `unpad` is correct for 
various _valid permutation mappings_ of various lengths and paddings. 
(Checking invalid permutation mappings is trivial and inefficient.)  
Can you think of a more efficient way to increase confidence in the 
correctness of this function?

(Note: `partition'` supports "larger" values of `n` and `p` for 
proofs, but this slows considerably for double-digit values of 
either. Why?  Who knows?)

```cryptol
unpad:
    {n, p}
    (fin n, fin p) =>
    [n + p][width (n + p)] -> [n][width n]
unpad pi =
    map drop (take (partition' ((>) `n) pi))
```

```cryptol
unpad_unpads:
    {n, p}
    (fin n, fin p) =>
    [n + p][width (n + p)] -> Bit
unpad_unpads pi =
    isPermutationMapping`{n + p} pi ==> isPermutationMapping`{n} (unpad pi)
```
