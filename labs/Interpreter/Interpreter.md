# Introduction

This lab provides an overview of Cryptol's interpreter.

## Prerequisites

Before working through this lab, you'll need
  * Cryptol to be installed and
  * this module to load successfully.

## Skills You'll Learn

By the end of this lab you will have gained experience using Cryptol's
interpreter.

You'll also gain experience with
  * changing the display base in the interpreter,
  * querying the built-in help system,
  * browsing symbols,
  * chaining commands with `let` and `it`,
  * loading and reloading modules,
  * evaluating expressions,
  * using the built-in editor, and
  * issuing batch commands.
    
## Load This Module

The first thing you should do is start up the Cryptol
interpreter. Instructions on installing and running the interpreter
can be found in this repository's [INSTALL.md](../../INSTALL.md) file. Once
you've got the interpreter started, follow along with this lab by
entering the commands found here into the interpreter.

This lab is a [literate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
Cryptol document --- that is, it can be loaded directly into the Cryptol
interpreter. Load this module from within the Cryptol interpreter running
in the `cryptol-course` directory with:

```Xcryptol-session
Loading module Cryptol
Cryptol> :m labs::Interpreter::Interpreter
Loading module Cryptol
Loading module labs::Interpreter::Interpreter
labs::Interpreter::Interpreter>
```

A Cryptol `module` is a named codeblock within a file.  The module
name is used when `import`-ing code into a larger Cryptol project, or
for interactively incorporating the code in the interpreter via the
`:module` command (described in the [Loading
Modules](#loading-modules) section below).  A file can only contain
one module, and the name of the module must match the filename.
Additionally, the module can have namespace characteristics, separated
by `::` delimiters.  The namespace values directly correlate with
directory structure surrounding the file.

In this file, we start by defining a new module for this lab:

```cryptol
module labs::Interpreter::Interpreter where
```

That indicates that this file `Interpreter.md` will be found in the
directory `labs/Interpreter`.

*(Note: you do not need to enter the `module` instruction into the
interpreter; the previous `:m ...` command loaded this literate
Cryptol file automatically.  In general, you should run 
`Xcryptol-session` commands in the interpreter and leave `cryptol`
code alone to be parsed by `:m ...`.)*

# Using the Cryptol interpreter

## Interpreter State

The interpreter has a number of different configuration settings. To
view them type `:set`.

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Interpreter::Interpreter> :set
ascii = off
base = 16
core-lint = off
debug = off
fp-base = 16
fp-format = free
hash-consing = on
ignore-safety = off
infLength = 5
mono-binds = on
path = ...
prover = z3
prover-stats = on
prover-validate = off
satNum = 1
show-examples = on
smtfile = -
tc-debug = 0
tc-solver = z3 -smt2 -in
tests = 100
warnDefaulting = off
warnShadowing = on
warnUninterp = on
```

The most common setting to change is `base`. The default is `base =
16`, which means the interpreter will display bitvectors by printing
their hexadecimal representations. For example,

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Interpreter::Interpreter> 0xa
0xa
labs::Interpreter::Interpreter> 10 : [4]
0xa
```

To make the interpreter display bitvectors in decimal (base 10), type
`:set base=10`. To change back to hexadecimal, type `:set base=16`.

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Interpreter::Interpreter> :set base=10
labs::Interpreter::Interpreter> 0xa
10
labs::Interpreter::Interpreter> 10 : [4]
10
labs::Interpreter::Interpreter> :set base=16
labs::Interpreter::Interpreter> 10 : [4]
0xa
```

Feel free to change this setting to what is most comfortable for you.

You'll notice there are many different things to configure. Most of
these are set to an appropriate default, but there are a few we will
touch on later.


## Interpreter Help

Cryptol's interpreter has a built-in help command. To invoke it, type
`:h` followed by the command you'd like to know more about. For
example, if we'd like to know more about the `:set base` command, we
can type:

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Interpreter::Interpreter> :h :set base

    base = 16

Default value: 16

The base to display words at (2, 8, 10, or 16).
```

Cryptol has a built-in command to reverse a list, called
`reverse`. Let's look at the help for this command.

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Interpreter::Interpreter> :h reverse

    reverse : {n, a} (fin n) => [n]a -> [n]a

Reverses the elements in a sequence.
```


## Colon commands

You'll notice that some commands start with a colon (`:`) and others
do not. The colon commands are commands that are outside of the
Cryptol language, and only exist in the interpreter. You can see a full listing of these commands by typing `:h`.

```Xcryptol-session

  :dumptests                Dump a tab-separated collection of tests for the given
                            expression into a file. The first column in each line is
                            the expected output, and the remainder are the inputs. The
                            number of tests is determined by the "tests" option.
                            Use filename "-" to write tests to stdout.
  :generate-foreign-header  Generate a C header file from foreign declarations in a Cryptol file.
  :file-deps                Show information about the dependencies of a file
  :module-deps              Show information about the dependencies of a module
```

The most used commands have to do with files (loading `:m` and
reloading `:r` modules), quitting the interpreter `:q`, and asking for
the type of an expression `:t`. Many of the commands have single
character shortcuts for ease of use.


## Browsing the Environment

The `:browse` command will list all of the type synonyms, constraint
synonyms, primitive types, and symbols currently loaded into the
interpreter. Upon startup, the interpreter preloads a prelude
containing the Cryptol language. This prelude can be modified, but
this will likely make any Cryptol specifications you write
incompatible with the rest of the world, and hence modifying the
prelude is discouraged.

About `:browse` --- If you enter `:b` into the interpreter you will
first see:

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Interpreter::Interpreter> :b
Type Synonyms
=============

  From Cryptol
  ------------

    type Bool = Bit
    type Char = [8]
    type lg2 n = width (max 1 n - 1)
    type String n = [n]Char
    type Word n = [n]

  From labs::Interpreter::Interpreter
  -----------------------------------
       
    type uint32_t = [32]
```

Type synonyms are helper functions used to express the type of some
data. For example, the number `10` can be expressed as a 32-bit word
via,

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Interpreter::Interpreter> 10 : Word 32
0x0000000a
```

The next things you'll see with `:browse` are some constraint
synonyms. These are helper functions used to express type
constraints. The ones preloaded into the interpreter unify different
types of comparison operators to `>=`. This just saves users from
having to express type constraints using only `>=`.

The next things you'll see with `:browse` are some primitive types. These
include comparison and arithmetic operators, type classes, basic
types, and some type constraints that help with expressing some
cryptographic type constraints elegantly. These are used when defining
the type of a function or variable. For example, the size of a
bitvector can be represented in terms of the width of a number:

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Interpreter::Interpreter> :t 10 : [width 32]
(10 : [width 32]) : [6]
```

Cryptol's symbols are given in the last section provided by `:browse`. This
is where you'll find all of the value operators (as opposed to type
operators). These are used when defining the value of a function or
variable. For example, `reverse` can be used to reverse the order of a
sequence of bitvectors:

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Interpreter::Interpreter> reverse [1, 2, 3] : [3][2]
[0x3, 0x2, 0x1]
```

Each of the items in the environment can be queried using `:help` (`:h` for short).


## Tab Completion and Scrolling

The interpreter supports [TAB
completion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_completion);
that is, pressing TAB will display all available symbols. And, if
you start typing a symbol and then press TAB, the interpreter will
attempt to complete the symbol you've started typing.

The interpreter also records a history of commands issued. All
commands are saved in a file named `.cryptol_commandHistory` which (by
default) resides in the top-level of your user directory. Pressing the
up and down arrows will scroll through this history, enabling fast
recall of previous commands.


## Chaining Commands --- `it` and `let`

The Cryptol interpreter supports a couple of ways to chain commands
together. The first way happens automatically. The `it` symbol is a
name automatically bound to the result of the last command the
interpreter evaluated. For example, if we can `reverse` a list, the
result `[3, 2, 1]` is automatically bound to the `it` symbol. We can
then `reverse it` and see that we get `[1, 2, 3]` back.

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Interpreter::Interpreter> :s base=10
labs::Interpreter::Interpreter> reverse [1, 2, 3] : [3][2]
[3, 2, 1]
labs::Interpreter::Interpreter> reverse it
[1, 2, 3]
```

Though, in the same way, now the value of `it` has become `[1, 2, 3]`. To bind a
value to a name (save it for later) we can use the `let` command. For
example, here we bind the result of `reverse [1, 2, 3] : [3][2]` to
`r`, then `reverse r` and show that the result is as expected and that
`r` still retains `[3, 2, 1]`.

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Interpreter::Interpreter> let r = reverse [1, 2, 3] : [3][2]
labs::Interpreter::Interpreter> r
[3, 2, 1]
labs::Interpreter::Interpreter> reverse r
[1, 2, 3]
labs::Interpreter::Interpreter> r
[3, 2, 1]
```

`let` is very helpful for debugging and program understanding;
however, it can cause confusion (as demonstrated in the simple example
below). Thus, industrial use of `let` is discouraged.

After running the example below, what is the value of `y`? Since, in
the interpreter, definitions can be overwritten, it's better to place
these kinds of definitions in a file and use the `:reload` (or `:r`)
command when editing to maintain a consistent state.

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Interpreter::Interpreter> let x = 0
labs::Interpreter::Interpreter> let y = x + 1
labs::Interpreter::Interpreter> let x = 1
```


## Loading and Reloading Files

Speaking of loading files, this lab can be loaded directly into the
interpreter using `:module` (as shown at the beginning of this lab) as
well as using `:load`. Where `:module` takes the module name, `:load`
instead takes the filename.

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Interpreter::Interpreter> :l labs/Interpreter/Interpreter.md
Loading module Cryptol
Loading module labs::Interpreter::Interpreter
labs::Interpreter::Interpreter>
```

Here we see that this file contains a module named
`labs::Interpreter::Interpreter`, which really just describes its filename
and directory path (labs/Interpreter/Interpreter.md).

We can browse the currently loaded module to see what new symbols it
provides. Remember that the interpreter supports TAB completion so you
only need to type `:b l` then press the TAB key and the interpreter
will fill in the rest.

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Interpreter::Interpreter> :b labs::Interpreter::Interpreter
Type Synonyms
=============
    
  type uint32_t = [32]
   
Symbols
=======
    
  f : uint32_t -> uint32_t
  x : uint32_t
  y : uint32_t
```

Here we see that this module provides one type synonym and three
symbols.  (If your result does not match, try reloading the module.)


## Loading Modules

To load a module by its name (rather than by filename), we use the
`:module` (or `:m`) command. Namespace elements of a module name
directly correlate with directory structure; e.g., this module
`labs::Interpreter::Interpreter` maps directly to the file at
`labs/Interpreter/Interpreter.md`. Thus in order for the module to be
found (essentially, finding the base directory for that path), either

  1) the Cryptol interpreter must have been started at the same base
     directory as the module, or

  2) the (fully-qualified) base directory of the module must be in
     the CRYPTOLPATH environment variable.

The CRYPTOLPATH approach is more robust, as it will work no matter
what directory Cryptol is started in. To set the CRYPTOLPATH variable
(in Linux) such that we can access the labs and specs for this class,
do this:

```sh
$ export CRYPTOLPATH=<path-to-cryptol-course>
cryptol-course$ cryptol
┏━╸┏━┓╻ ╻┏━┓╺┳╸┏━┓╻
┃  ┣┳┛┗┳┛┣━┛ ┃ ┃ ┃┃
┗━╸╹┗╸ ╹ ╹   ╹ ┗━┛┗━╸
version 3.2.0.99
https://cryptol.net  :? for help
Loading module Cryptol
```

```Xcryptol-session
Cryptol> :m labs::Interpreter::Interpreter
Loading module Cryptol
Loading module labs::Interpreter::Interpreter
labs::Interpreter::Interpreter>
```

## Editing

The Cryptol interpreter supports editing the currently loaded file or
module via `:e`. However, if no file or module is loaded `:e` will
allow you to edit the Cryptol prelude, which is very dangerous. When
you type `:e`, Cryptol will open the current file or module in a text
editor, and will then reload the file into the interpreter when the editor
is closed. The default
editor is [vim](https://www.vim.org/), but can be changed via setting
an environment variable called `EDITOR`. For example, if in a Linux
like environment, the following command will change the default to
[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).

```sh
$ export EDITOR="emacs -nw"
```

## Batch Commands

Interpreter commands can be issued directly from the command line, or
from a batch file. For example, here we issue some commands from the
command line using the interpreter's `-c` flag:

```sh
$ cryptol -c ":m labs::Interpreter::Interpreter" -c ":s base=10" -c "x + 2"
Loading module Cryptol
Loading module labs::Interpreter::Interpreter
3
```

And here we issue the same commands by running the `test.sry` batch
file using the interpreter's `-b` flag:

```sh
$ cat labs/Interpreter/test.sry
:m labs::Interpreter::Interpreter
:s base=10
x + 2
$ cryptol -b labs/Interpreter/test.sry
Loading module Cryptol
Loading module labs::Interpreter::Interpreter
3
```

## Usage options

The last few items covered here (and more) can be found querying Cryptol's usage options via:

```sh
$ cryptol --help
Usage: cryptol [OPTIONS]
  -b FILE     --batch=FILE             run the script provided and exit
  -e          --stop-on-error          stop script execution as soon as an error occurs.
  -c COMMAND  --command=COMMAND        run the given command and then exit; if multiple --command arguments are given, run them in the order they appear on the command line (overrides --batch)
              --color=MODE             control the color output for the terminal, which may be 'auto', 'none' or 'always' (default: 'auto')
  -v          --version                display version number
  -h          --help                   display this message
              --no-unicode-logo        Don't use unicode characters in the REPL logo
              --ignore-cryptolrc       disable reading of .cryptolrc files
              --cryptolrc-script=FILE  read additional .cryptolrc files
              --cryptolpath-only       only look for .cry files in CRYPTOLPATH; don't use built-in locations

Influential environment variables:
    CRYPTOLPATH
        A `:`-separated list of directories to be searched for Cryptol
        modules in addition to the default locations
    SBV_{ABC,BOOLECTOR,CVC4,MATHSAT,YICES,Z3}_OPTIONS
        A string of command-line arguments to be passed to the
        corresponding solver invoked for `:sat` and `:prove`
```

## Conclusion

That's all for the interpreter for now. This course is only designed
to be an introduction, so not everything is covered in detail. We
encourage you to explore more on your own, and if you have questions,
a great place to ask is the [cryptol-users mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/a/galois.com/forum/#!forum/cryptol-users).

## Miscellaneous

Here are a few miscellaneous definitions so that the browse
command has something to show after loading this module.

```cryptol
type uint32_t = [32]

x = 1 : uint32_t

y = x + 10

f a = a + y
```
