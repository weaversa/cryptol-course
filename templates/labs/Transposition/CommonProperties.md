# Introduction

`labs::CryptoProofs::CryptoProofs` introduced the concepts of 
_injectivity_ and _inversion_, among others.  In this lab, we build 
upon these concepts, introducing higher-order functions (functions 
that take functions as values) and specifying reusable property 
definitions that can be imported into other modules.

## Prerequisites

Before working through this lab, you'll need 
  * Cryptol to be installed,
  * this module to load successfully, and
  * an editor for completing the exercises in this file.

You'll also need experience with
  * loading modules and evaluating functions in the interpreter,
  * sequence and `Integer` types,
  * manipulating sequences using `#`, `take`, `split`, and `join`,
  * writing functions and properties,
  * sequence comprehensions,
  * logical, comparison, and arithmetic operators,
  * lambda functions, and
  * `:prove` and `:sat` commands

## Skills You'll Learn

By the end of this lab you will be able to define higher-order 
functions (functions of functions) and predicates, and apply them to 
various cryptographic applications (e.g. decryption inverts 
encryption and most block ciphers are injective).
  
## Load This Module

This lab is a
[literate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) Cryptol
document --- that is, it can be loaded directly into the Cryptol
interpreter. Load this module from within the Cryptol interpreter
running in the `cryptol-course` directory with:

```Xcryptol-session
Cryptol> :m labs::Transposition::CommonProperties
Loading module Cryptol
Loading module Cryptol
Loading module specs::Primitive::Symmetric::Cipher::Block::Cipher
Loading module specs::Primitive::Symmetric::Cipher::Block::DES
Loading module labs::CryptoProofs::CryptoProofs
Loading module labs::Transposition::CommonProperties
```

The proofs in this lab require an array of different theorem provers
supported by Cryptol. In order to solve them, we recommend using the
Cryptol Docker container described in [INSTALL.md](../../INSTALL.md) for 
this course.

The first line of a Cryptol module needs to be a module definition:

```cryptol
module labs::Transposition::CommonProperties where
```

You do not need to enter the above into the interpreter; the previous 
`:m ...` command loaded this literate Cryptol file automatically.
In general, you should run `Xcryptol-session` commands in the 
interpreter and only change `cryptol` code as directed by the 
exercises, reloading for `:m ...` to import your changes.

In this lab, we'll redo exercises from 
`labs::CryptoProofs::CryptoProofs`, higher-order style, so we'll 
import the same dependency.  We'll give it an alias this time so 
Cryptol doesn't spew warnings about shadowing its definition of `f`:

```cryptol
import labs::CryptoProofs::CryptoProofs (known_key, known_ct, DESFixParity)
import specs::Primitive::Symmetric::Cipher::Block::DES (DES)
```

# Higher-Order Functions: Functions can be Values!

Let's count to 10...

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Transposition::CommonProperties> let _1 = 1 : Integer
labs::Transposition::CommonProperties> _1
1
labs::Transposition::CommonProperties> 1 + it
2
labs::Transposition::CommonProperties> 1 + it
3
labs::Transposition::CommonProperties> 1 + it
4
labs::Transposition::CommonProperties> 1 + it
5
labs::Transposition::CommonProperties> 1 + it
6
labs::Transposition::CommonProperties> 1 + it
7
labs::Transposition::CommonProperties> 1 + it
8
labs::Transposition::CommonProperties> 1 + it
9
labs::Transposition::CommonProperties> 1 + it
10
```

That was repetitive.  Let's just ask Cryptol to count to 10:

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Transposition::CommonProperties> take`{10} (iterate (\x -> 1 + x) (1 : Integer))
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

Adding 1 to something seems like a common task.  Let's name it...

```cryptol
S: Integer -> Integer
S x = 1 + x
```

Peano would be proud.  Wouldn't it be nice if Cryptol could just 
reuse `S` to repeatedly increment a counter?

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Transposition::CommonProperties> :t \(x : Integer) -> 1 + x
(\(x : Integer) -> 1 + x) : Integer -> Integer
labs::Transposition::CommonProperties> :t S
S : Integer -> Integer
```

Wait a minute...it can!

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Transposition::CommonProperties> take`{10} (iterate S 1)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

So functions can be passed around as values.  Great!  A function that 
takes a function as a value and/or returns one as a result is a 
_higher-order_ function; a function that does not is _first-order_.
But why bother?

# Five Killer Apps: Silence of the Lambdas

From `labs::CryptoProofs::CryptoProofs`:

> | Proof | Invocation |
> |-|-|
> | Function reversal | `:sat \x -> f x == y` |
> | Proof of inversion | `:prove \x -> g (f x) == x` |
> | Proof of injectivity | `:prove \x y -> x != y ==> f x != f y` |
> | Collision detection | `:sat \x y -> f x == f y /\ x != y` |
> | Equivalence checking | `:prove \x -> f x == g x` |

Lambda functions are fun, but in order to reuse them, we would need 
to name them.  We could be silly and just assign directly to these 
lambda functions, filling in other parameters as necessary...

| Proof | Invocation |
|-|-|
| Function reversal | `maps_to = \f y -> \x -> f x == y` |
| Proof of inversion | `inverts = \f' f -> \x -> f' (f x) == x` |
| Proof of injectivity | `injective = \f -> \x y -> x != y ==> f x != f y` |
| Collision detection | `collides = \f -> \x y -> f x == f y /\ x != y` |
| Equivalence checking | `equiv = \f f' -> \x -> f x == f' x` |

...but Cryptol supports a more familiar function definition syntax, 
so let's use that:

```cryptol
/**
 * `f` maps to `y` from `x`
 */
maps_to:
    {d, c} Eq c => (d -> c) -> c -> d -> Bit
maps_to f y x =
    f x == y

/**
 * `f'` _inverts_ `f` iff when `f` maps `x` to `f x`, 
 * `f'` maps `f x` back to `x`.
 */
inverts:
    {d, c} Eq d => (c -> d) -> (d -> c) -> d -> Bit
inverts g f x =
    g (f x) == x

/**
 * `f` is _injective_ iff it maps distinct elements of its domain `d`
 * to distinct elements of its codomain `d`
 */
injective:
    {d, c} (Eq d, Eq c) => (d -> c) -> d -> d -> Bit
injective f x x' =
    x != x' ==> f x != f x'

/**
 * `x` and `x'` differ, but `f` maps them to the same value
 */
collides:
    {d, c} (Eq d, Eq c) => (d -> c) -> d -> d -> Bit
collides f x x' =
    x != x' /\ f x == f x'
```

Cryptol went ahead and reserved infix operator `===` to denote that 
functions map the same value to the same value, so `:prove f === f'` 
is shorthand for `:prove \x -> f x == f' x`.  Functional equivalence 
must be pretty important!

# DES Exercises, Redux

Because the DES exercises were so much fun last time, let's revisit 
them with our newfound appreciation for higher-order functions!  (For 
exercises in this module, add your answers to empty `Xcryptol-session` 
prompts.)

**EXERCISE**: Use `boolector` to reverse `DES.encrypt` for 
`known_key` and `known_ct` from `CryptoProofs`, using `maps_to`.  (In 
other words, instruct the interpreter to find a plaintext such that 
encrypting that plaintext using DES with the `known_key` produces the 
`known_ct`.)  Avoid lambda.

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Transposition::CommonProperties> :s prover=boolector
labs::Transposition::CommonProperties> 
```

(Hint: A curried function of two arguments can be viewed as a 
function of one argument to a function of one argument...)

**EXERCISE**: Use ABC to prove that `DES.encrypt` and `DES.decrypt` 
are mutual inverses for all possible `pt`, given the same `key`.
Do not mention `pt` in your proof commands.

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Transposition::CommonProperties> :s prover=abc
labs::Transposition::CommonProperties> 
```

**EXERCISE**: Use Boolector to prove that `DES.encrypt` is injective 
for any given `key`.  Do not mention `pt`s in your proof command.  
Meditate on the nature of lambda and the (f)utility of names.

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Transposition::CommonProperties> :s prover=boolector
labs::Transposition::CommonProperties> 
```

**EXERCISE**: Use Yices to find two different keys and a single 
plaintext such that both keys encrypt that plaintext to the same 
ciphertext.  Mention `key`s to alias `DES.encrypt` in a `where` 
clause, but do not mention `key` in the lambda function you pass to 
your command.  Guess whether such a collision will be found before 
you observe a collision of black holes in nearby outer space.

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Transposition::CommonProperties> :s prover=yices
labs::Transposition::CommonProperties> 
```

**EXERCISE**: Use ABC to prove that the two keys you just found are 
equivalent keys; i.e., prove that keyed `DES.encrypt` and 
`DES.decrypt`, respectively, are equivalent for *all* `pt`/`ct`.  
Avoid lambda.

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Transposition::CommonProperties> :s prover=abc
labs::Transposition::CommonProperties> 
```

**EXERCISE**: Use ABC to prove that `DES.encrypt key` is equivalent 
to `DES.encrypt (DESFixParity key)`.  Do not mention `pt` in your 
proof command.

```Xcryptol-session
labs::Transposition::CommonProperties> :s prover=abc
labs::Transposition::CommonProperties> 
```

**EXERCISE**: Finally, try to find a collision with keys of distinct 
parity; alternatively, try to prove that no such collision exists.  
(This wasn't in `CryptoProofs`, but let's be extra and observe the 
consequences...)  Feel free to go crazy with lambda.  Ponder the 
abject hopelessness of classical crypto in a post-quantum world...

```Text
labs::Transposition::CommonProperties> :s prover=abc
labs::Transposition::CommonProperties> 
```

# Conclusion

This lab demonstrated higher-order functions and revisited the 
`CryptoProofs` with named higher-order properties.  Whether one 
chooses to use lambda notation or higher-order functions is mostly a 
matter of taste, though it seems useful to codify properties around 
which entire branches of mathematics have been studied...
