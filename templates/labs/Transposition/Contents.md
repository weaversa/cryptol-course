Here, there are a series of labs on transposition ciphers. They are
meant to be visited in the following order:
* [CommonProperties](./CommonProperties.md): an offshoot of `CryptoProofs` treating higher-order functions and properties.
* [Transposition](./Transposition.md): a library defining common concepts for transposition ciphers; most notably permutation mappings and supporting functions and properties.
* [Esrever](./Esrever.md): a trivial reverse "cipher" demonstrating how to specify permutation mappings for the encrypt and decrypt functions from Transposition:
* [Scytale](./Scytale.md): an adaptation of the Scytale cipher described in Programming Cryptol.
* [RailFence](./RailFence.md): a specification of the Rail Fence cipher, which is easy on paper but hard in Cryptol.
* [Route](./Route.md): an unguided suggestion for sufficiently motivated course participants to define the Route cipher using concepts learned in prior labs.
