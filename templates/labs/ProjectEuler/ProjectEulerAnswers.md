# Introduction

This lab provides you an opportunity to test your mettle against some
challenging computational puzzles. These puzzles were selected from
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) and can be solved using
Cryptol's automated theorem proving interface.

## Prerequisites

Before working through this lab, you'll need 
  * Cryptol to be installed,
  * this module to load successfully, and
  * an editor for completing the exercises in this file.

You'll also need experience with
  * loading modules and evaluating functions in the interpreter,
  * Cryptol's sequence and `Integer` types,
  * the `:prove` command,
  * manipulating sequences using `#`, `take`, `split`, `join`,
    `head`, `tail`, and `reverse`,
  * writing functions and properties,
  * sequence comprehensions,
  * functions with curried parameters,
  * logical, comparison, arithmetic, indexing, slicing, and
    conditional operators, and
  * the `sum` and `carry` operators.

## Skills You'll Learn

By the end of this lab you will be a puzzle master!

## Load This Module

This lab is a
[literate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) Cryptol
document --- that is, it can be loaded directly into the Cryptol
interpreter. Load this module from within the Cryptol interpreter
running in the `cryptol-course` directory with:

```Xcryptol-session
Loading module Cryptol
Cryptol> :m labs::ProjectEuler::ProjectEulerAnswers
Loading module Cryptol
Loading module labs::ProjectEuler::cipher1
Loading module labs::ProjectEuler::keylog
Loading module labs::ProjectEuler::cipher2
Loading module labs::ProjectEuler::ProjectEulerAnswers
```

We start by defining a new module for this lab and importing some accessory
modules that we will use:

```cryptol
module labs::ProjectEuler::ProjectEulerAnswers where

import labs::ProjectEuler::cipher1
import labs::ProjectEuler::keylog
import labs::ProjectEuler::cipher2
```

You do not need to enter the above into the interpreter; the previous 
`:m ...` command loaded this literate Cryptol file automatically.
In general, you should run `Xcryptol-session` commands in the 
interpreter and leave `cryptol` code alone to be parsed by `:m ...`.

### [Problem 9](https://projecteuler.net/problem=9)

> A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c,
> for which a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>= c<sup>2</sup>.
>
> For example, 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup> = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5<sup>2</sup>.
>
> There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b +
> c = 1000. Find this triple.

```cryptol
pythagoreantriple : Integer -> Integer -> Integer -> Bit
property pythagoreantriple a b c =
    a^^2 + b^^2 == c^^2 /\
    a + b + c == 1000   /\
    a > 0 /\ b > 0
```


### [Problem 34](https://projecteuler.net/problem=34)

> 145 is a curious number, as 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.
>
> Find all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of
> their digits.  Note: as 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not
> included.

(Aside: these numbers are called
[factorions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorion))

*Hints*: 
 * the factorial function is usually defined recursively, but
 that tends to make SAT solving difficult. Since you only need to
 calculate the factorial of the numbers 0-9, make your function just
 do a case by case calculation. 
 * To get the digital representation of
 the number, create a function which takes in a number and a list of
 numbers and returns `True` exactly when the list is the base 10
 representation. Finally, it can be shown that the most number of
 digits a factorion can have is 6.

```cryptol
factorial n = if n == 2 then      2 else
              if n == 3 then      6 else
              if n == 4 then     24 else
              if n == 5 then    120 else
              if n == 6 then    720 else
              if n == 7 then   5040 else
              if n == 8 then  40320 else
              if n == 9 then 362880 else
              1

powersoften = [1] # [ 10 * i | i <- powersoften ]

alldigits l = [ 0 <= i /\ i < 10 | i <- l ] == ~0

matchdigits l =
    [ i * t
    | i <- reverse l
    | t <- powersoften ]

formnumber l =
    sum (matchdigits l)

basetenrep n l =
    n == formnumber l /\
    alldigits l       /\
    head l != 0

### [Problem 43](https://projecteuler.net/problem=43)

### [Problem 59](https://projecteuler.net/problem=59) (Modified)

> Each character on a computer is assigned a unique code and the
> preferred standard is
> [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII). For example, uppercase
> A = 65, asterisk (*) = 42, and lowercase k = 107.
>
> A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes
> to ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret
> key. The advantage with the XOR function is that using the same
> encryption key on the cipher text, restores the plain text; for
> example, 65 ^ 42 = 107, then 107 ^ 42 = 65.
>
> For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the
> plaintext message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user
> would keep the encrypted message and the encryption key in different
> locations, and without both "halves", it is impossible to decrypt
> the message.
>
> Unfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the
> modified method is to use a password as a key. If the password is
> shorter than the message, which is likely, the key is repeated
> cyclically throughout the message. The balance for this method is
> using a sufficiently long password key for security, but short
> enough to be memorable.
>
> Your task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of
> three lower case characters. Using cipher1.cry, a file containing
> the encrypted ASCII codes, and the knowledge that the plain text
> must contain common English words, decrypt the message and find the
> sum of the ASCII values in the original text.
>

Note: cipher1.cry contains a different cipher encrypted under a
different key from the original. The original Project Euler problem
can be found in cipher2.cry.

"Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.  Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.  But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate-we can not consecrate-we can not hallow-this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us-that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion-that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain-that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom-and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."
