# Programming with Cryptol

**Purpose:** The purpose of the course is to provide an overview of
the capabilities of [Cryptol](https://github.com/GaloisInc/cryptol), a
domain specific language for cryptography. The material can be
undertaken in a self-paced fashion, or is amenable to a more
structured classroom (virtual or physical) presentation and
experimentation environment. The course also briefly touches on the
[Software Analysis Workbench](https://github.com/GaloisInc/saw-script)
(SAW), a related tool for proving properties about software.

## How To Take This Course

This course is composed of a series of labs which introduce aspects of
applications of Cryptol. Many of the labs in this course are taught
using [literate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
Cryptol documents --- that is, they render nicely in a web browser or
editor with Markdown support, and they can also be loaded directly
into the Cryptol interpreter. This `README.md` is no exception! We
start by defining a new module for this file:

```cryptol
module README where
```

Labs have exercises that look like this:

**EXERCISE**: Literate Cryptol documents are meant to be edited while
you work through a lab. For instance, you might be asked to fill in a
portion of a Cryptol snippet:

```comment
CBCEncrypt : {n} (fin n) => ([128] -> [128]) -> [128] -> [n][128] -> [n][128]
CBCEncrypt Ek iv pt = undefined
    //  Implement a parameterized version of the CBC encryption mode

CBCDecrypt : {n} (fin n) => ([128] -> [128]) -> [128] -> [n][128] -> [n][128]
CBCDecrypt Dk iv ct = undefined
    //  Implement a parameterized version of the CBC decryption mode
```

You might solve this problem by editing the literate document and
changing this snippet to the following:

```cryptol
CBCEncrypt : {n} (fin n) => ([128] -> [128]) -> [128] -> [n][128] -> [n][128]
CBCEncrypt Ek iv pt =
    [ Ek (pi ^ ci) | pi <- pt | ci <- [iv] # CBCEncrypt Ek iv pt ]

CBCDecrypt : {n} (fin n) => ([128] -> [128]) -> [128] -> [n][128] -> [n][128]
CBCDecrypt Dk iv ct =
    [ Dk ci ^ ci' | ci <- ct | ci' <- [iv] # ct ]
```

Exercises will often have corresponding properties that you can use to
verify your work. For example:

```cryptol
property CBCInverts iv (pt : [100][128]) =
    CBCDecrypt (\x -> x - 1) iv (CBCEncrypt (\x -> x + 1) iv pt) == pt
```

Don't worry if Cryptol is not yet installed on your computer -- the
first lab walks you through [installing and running Cryptol](INSTALL.md).
